    " \n",
    "The full description for this variable is:\n",
    " \n",
    "Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air, not the surface (skin) temperature. It is strongly recommended that a variable with this standard name should have a units_metadata attribute, with one of the values \"\"on-scale\"\" or \"\"difference\"\", whichever is appropriate for the data, because it is essential to know whether the temperature is on-scale (meaning relative to the origin of the scale indicated by the units) or refers to temperature differences (implying that the origin of the temperature scale is irrevelant), in order to convert the units correctly (cf. https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#temperature-units). \n",

    "How many standard names are there about the Ionosphare?\t\"There is 1 CF Standard Name related to the ionosphere:\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Name**: `altimeter_range_correction_due_to_ionosphere`\n",
    " - **Canonical Units**: meters (m)\n",
    " - **Description**: The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. To apply the altimeter range correction it must be added to the quantity with standard name altimeter_range. \"\"Correction_due_to_ionosphere\"\" means a correction for the atmosphere\\'s electron content in the ionosphere. Additional altimeter range corrections are given by the quantities with standard names altimeter_range_correction_due_to_wet_troposphere, altimeter_range_correction_due_to_dry_troposphere, sea_surface_height_correction_due_to_air_pressure_at_low_frequency and sea_surface_height_correction_due_to_air_pressure_and_wind_at_high_frequency.\"\tag.stephens@stfc.ac.uk\n",

    "\"\"Sea surface height\"\" is a time-varying quantity. \"\"Height_above_X\"\" means the vertical distance above the named surface X. \"\"Lowest astronomical tide\"\" describes a local vertical reference based on the lowest water level that can be expected to occur under average meteorological conditions and under any combination of astronomical conditions. The tidal component of sea surface height describes the predicted variability of the sea surface due to astronomic forcing (chiefly lunar and solar cycles) and shallow water resonance of tidal components; for example as generated based on harmonic analysis, or resulting from the application of harmonic tidal series as boundary conditions to a numerical tidal model.\"\tag.stephens@stfc.ac.uk\n",
    "Is there any general rule for the construction of standard names for errors and uncertainties ?\t\"Right now, errors and uncertainties are done with the standard name modifier `standard_error`, see Appendix C of the CF Conventions (https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.12/cf-conventions.html#standard-name-modifiers). \n",

    "Should coordinate variables be assigned the same names as their respective dimensions?\tWe recommend that the name of a multidimensional coordinate variable should not match the name of any of its dimensions because that precludes supplying a coordinate variable for the dimension. This practice also avoids potential bugs in applications that determine coordinate variables by only checking for a name match between a dimension and a variable and not checking that the variable is one dimensional.\t\n",
    "Is it okay to represent \"convective_rainfall_amount\" with millimeters (\"mm\") as the units?\t\"Yes, CF uses the Udunits package for units support. Different units are are allowed as long as they are equivalent. 1kg m^-2 is equivalent to 1mm of rainfall. This equivalence is established due to the density of water (1000 kg m^-3).\n",
